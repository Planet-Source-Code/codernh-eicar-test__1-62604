this is a simple program to test if your onboard anti virus software is
working properly...follow directions on program and it should
trip your anti virus software..or in some cases your anti virus software
will catch it and know its a test...if you do program properly and your
antivirus software does not catch it..then your antivirus software
is basically JUNK!...this uses eicar which is the standard test for
anti virus software..THIS IS NOT A VIRUS!! it is an ascii test string
that tests software.
